* Patients with a late referral status started dialysis less than 90 days after first seeing a nephrologist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data from Quebec was excluded for 2012 to 2019 due to significant under-reporting of dialysis data between 2011 and 2019. While dialysis data submission for Quebec recommenced in 2020, there still exists potential for under-reporting of incidence in 2020–2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
