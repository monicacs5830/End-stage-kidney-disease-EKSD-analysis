RPMP: Rate per million population.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to significant under-reporting of Quebec dialysis data between 2011 and 2019, Quebec data is included in this table for the last 2 years only. While dialysis data submission for Quebec recommenced in 2020, there still exists potential for under-reporting of prevalence in 2020–2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,
