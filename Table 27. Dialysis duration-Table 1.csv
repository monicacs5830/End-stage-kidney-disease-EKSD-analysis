Data from the last 3 years is utilized to provide a robust measure of dialysis duration prior to first kidney transplant.,,,,,,,,
"In the calculation of median days on dialysis, pre-emptive kidney transplant recipients were given a value of 0 for their wait time.",,,,,,,,
A patient who receives a pre-emptive transplant has not been treated with dialysis prior to the transplant.,,,,,,,,
"There were 3,501 adult first kidney transplants performed in Canada (excluding Quebec) between 2019 and 2021; of these, 412 were pre-emptive transplants.",,,,,,,,
