# End-stage-kidney-disease-EKSD-analysis

#### Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) website. The dataset, Treatment of End-Stage Organ Failure in Canada, includes data tables from 2012 to 2021 on renal replacement therapies for EKSD patients, including incidence, prevalence, survival, and wait-lists.

#### Tableau Dashboards
The Tableau dashboards created for this project showcase the trends of EKSD treatments in Canada by age, province, gender, and treatment type. The dashboards display the incidence, prevalence, and survival of EKSD patients and provide valuable insights into the factors affecting the management of EKSD treatments in Canada.

#### Conclusion
Through this project, we hope to contribute to the understanding of EKSD treatments and improve the management of healthcare services for EKSD patients in Canada.
