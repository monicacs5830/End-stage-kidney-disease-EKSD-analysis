Summary,,,,,,,,
"These data tables contain information about trends in renal replacement therapies (dialysis and transplantation) for end-stage kidney disease patients, including incidence, prevalence, survival and patients on wait-lists.",,,,,,,,
"Dialysis data from Quebec is reported where possible for 2020 and 2021; dialysis data between 2011 and 2019 is excluded due to significant under-reporting during this time. Transplant data from Quebec was not included in these data tables because of significant under-reporting between 2012 and 2021. This may lead to biased results. 

Population estimates used to calculate rates per million population and other information regarding analytical methods can be found in Canadian Organ Replacement Register â€” Methodology Notes and Supplementary Information, 2012 to 2021.
